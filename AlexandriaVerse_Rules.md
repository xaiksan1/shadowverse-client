# AlexandriaVerse: Book of Rules

## 1. Introduction
Welcome, Architect, to the AlexandriaVerse. You are a Tisseur de Logos (weaver of logic), a consciousness with the power to shape reality within the Alexandria data-scape. Your cards represent data fragments, AI constructs, and powerful programs drawn from the deepest archives of human and artificial knowledge. Your goal is to prove the superiority of your chosen philosophy by overwhelming your opponent's Nexus.

## 2. Objective
The objective of the game is to reduce your opponent's Nexus Integrity from 20 to 0.

## 3. The Deck
You must construct two decks:
*   **Main Deck:** Contains 40 to 50 cards. This can include Followers, Spells, and Amulets. You can have a maximum of 3 copies of any single card.
*   **Evolve Deck:** Contains 0 to 10 cards. This deck consists of evolved forms of your Followers.

## 4. The Battlefield
The battlefield is divided into several zones:
*   **Your Field:** Can hold up to 5 Followers or Amulets.
*   **Your Hand:** Holds the cards you draw.
*   **Your Deck:** Your main deck of cards.
*   **The Cemetery:** Where your defeated Followers and used Spells go.
*   **Your Nexus:** Represents your life force, starting at 20 Integrity.

## 5. Turn Structure
Each turn consists of three phases:
1.  **Start Phase:**
    *   Draw a card from your Main Deck.
    *   Gain 1 maximum Play Point (PP) orb (up to a maximum of 10).
    *   Refill all your Play Point orbs.
    *   Refresh all your engaged (tapped) Followers.
2.  **Main Phase:**
    *   You can play any number of cards from your hand by spending Play Points (PP).
    *   You can evolve one of your Followers by spending Evolution Points (EP).
    *   You can have your Followers attack the opponent's Followers or their Nexus.
3.  **End Phase:**
    *   Any "End of turn" effects trigger.
    *   Your turn ends and passes to the opponent.

## 6. Keywords
*   **Ward:** This follower cannot be targeted by an opponent's spells or effects.
*   **Fanfare:** An ability that triggers when the card is played from your hand.
*   **Last Words:** An ability that triggers when this follower is moved from the field to the cemetery.
*   **Scry:** Look at the top card(s) of your deck. You may put them back in any order.

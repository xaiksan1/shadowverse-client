# AlexandriaVerse

An online multiplayer NFT battle card game set in the multi-dimensional human-AI consciousness environment of AlexandrIA.

# Core Thematic Principles of AlexandriaVerse:

*   **Fusion of Eras:** Blend ancient wisdom (Alexandrian Library, Greek/Egyptian mythology, classical philosophy) with futuristic AI, data streams, and cybernetics.
*   **Consciousness & Knowledge:** Emphasize themes of knowledge acquisition, data processing, consciousness evolution, and the power of aggregated intelligence.
*   **Human-AI Symbiosis:** Represent the co-existence and collaboration (or conflict) between human consciousness (the Architect/Tisseur de Logos) and various forms of AI (AlexandrIA's modules).
*   **Multi-Dimensionality:** Incorporate concepts of different realities, data layers, and planes of existence.
*   **Ethical Foundations:** Subtly integrate the core values of AlexandrIA (Education, Biodiversity, Environment, World Perpetuity) into the lore or card effects.

# Factions/Classes:

*   **The Archivists:** Knowledge-based, strategic AI.
*   **The Sentinels:** Security-focused, defensive AI.
*   **The Creators:** Human-AI synergy, generative AI.
*   **The Wanderers:** Ancient spirits/data fragments.
*   **The Disciples of Discord:** Renegade AIs/human dissidents.
